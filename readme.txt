Just want your Instagram data to play with? Here it is. (Well, at least the 20 latest pictures)

== Description ==

This plugin will fetch the latest 20 pictures, with all available associated data, and leave it for you to play with.
It makes no design decisions and tries to stay out of your way as much as possible.

That means that you have to be comfortable with writing your own template to display and style the data.
It's really simple though, and a super simple template is included as an example.

Just copy it to your theme directory and edit away.

The data is fetched from your Instagram page (http://instagram.com/[username]), so no keys or secrets are needed.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `super-simple-instagram-widget` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add it to a widget area and set your username

== Changelog ==
